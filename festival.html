            <p>Considered a difficult art form, Yakshagana lacks a written script and depends entirely on the artist's ability to be spontaneous, to improvise, to be a good orator and have a sound knowledge of the plot and character. The unique art form of Yakshagana has various elements like dance (Nrithya), makeup (Bannagarike or Mukhavarnike), background singing and direction (Bhagvathike), two forms of drums (Chande Maddale) and conversation (Arthagarike). The art form is 500 years old, and the entire portrayal takes place in refined Kannada, without even a word of any other language. It is an important tradition and also a prevalent art form.Siddi community's Dammami dance is also another traditional dance form. </p>

            <p>The recent uproar over Tamil Nadu's bull-taming festival of Jallikattu has drawn attention to Karnataka's Buffalo race called Kambala. The annual buffalo race, a two-day festival, is an integral part of the rural community and is considered a sport as well as a tradition. Earlier, the rewards used to be coconuts, but these have been replaced by medals in recent times. The festival can be traced back over 800 years and is celebrated to please Lord Kadri Manjunatha, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. In the last few years, it has received a lot of backlash from organisations concerned about animal cruelty. However, the recent judgement by the Supreme Court has allowed the celebration of this annual festival.</p>
