            <p>Earlier, painting involved not only the act itself but the entire process, from making one's colours to watching as they come to life. Paper, wood, cloth, etc. were some of the materials artists used as a base for their paintings. Brushes weren't made from synthetic materials but were made from the original hair of animals like camels, goat, and squirrel. The Mysuru style of paintings usually are representations of legends, mythical scenes, and the royal family. This style of painting from Karnataka is known for its simplicity and intricate detailing across the country. The artists used a particular gesso paste, consisting of zinc oxide and gum, which formed a protective layer on the painting, which has kept them undamaged even after 150 years..Karnataka is home to 50 different tribes, each having their traditions and customs. Tribal art is another indigenous art form. Hase Chitra mud painting is an art form emerging from the Shimoga and Karwar districts and is currently being revived. </p>

            <p>The Kodava people, believed to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great, have a distinct traditional attire which acts as an immediate differentiator.Ilkal sarees are one of the popular traditional attires of women in Karnataka. Traditionally worn by women in the rural area, Ilkal sarees have now caught the attention of the entire country. Ilkal sarees are named after a town by the same name in Bagalkot district of Karnataka. These are now sought after by saree lovers across the nation due to the unique process by which they are woven. They are made using a different looping process known as Tope Teni. This 8th-century method is entirely undertaken by the weaver himself, without the use of machines. The sarees are handwoven and are in high demand by the locals during the wedding season.</p>
